    <string name="aboutUni">International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC) is one of the top graded Government approved private universities in Bangladesh. The credit for the idea of establishing this University goes to Islamic University Chittagong Trust (IUCT), which is the founder organization of the University. This Trust is a non-political and non-profit oriented voluntary organization, registered with the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Bangladesh under the Societies Act XXI of 1860. This Trust felt the need for a university under private initiative in view of the absence of institutions of higher learning based on Islamic vision of life in the public sector.</string>
